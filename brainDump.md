## 🎯 The Plan

The theme is **"Every Action Has a Cost."**  
I asked ChatGPT for name ideas and I **really liked** the name: `Oopsie Economy`.  
So I’ll make something around city-building or resource-spending, where you do stuff and it *costs* you something.

I don't wanna use basic stuff like health or generic player stats.  
I want it to be *dumb* and *unique* (spelling errors are free flavor — don’t file an issue on it 💀).

---

## 🧪 The Idea

Since I’m a dumb guy, I’ll make the player also make **dumb decisions** with money (or some cursed in-game currency) in order to progress.

You are a **wizard**.  
A lonely, kinda pathetic wizard.  
And like me, you want a girlfriend 😔.

So the wizard’s goal is to make a **love potion**.

But what kind of potions? Hmm...

💡 Got it — ***Love potions.***  
Why?  
Because the wizard is down bad and wants to fall in love. How wholesome. (and a lil desperate)

But here's the twist:  
You need **money/items/resources to do ANYTHING**, and the economy is totally janked.

Even though you're trying to collect ingredients, you're constantly getting scammed, or your actions backfire.

---

## 🐸 Setup

You play as a **delusional wizard** trying to win the love of his crush — maybe another wizard, a frog, or a tax collector.  
(Frog crush is fire ngl.)

But: **the economy is cursed AF**.  
Every time you try to do something (gather, buy, steal, etc.), you get scammed, overcharged, or cause chaos.

> You must collect all ingredients before the economy collapses, you go broke, or worse… fall in love with your own potion 🏳️‍🌈

---

## 🎮 Game Loop Breakdown

**Your Actions =** Trying to collect stuff  
**Your Costs =** The consequences of your dumb decisions

### Costs Can Be:
- You get scammed
- You lose something random
- The economy reacts (prices surge, taxes increase, shops close)
- NPCs remember your dumb choices
- Frogs revolt. Literally.
- The game gets *progressively worse*

The more you mess around, the more the world starts to fall apart. That's the point.

---

## 🧠 Summary

The main thing is:
- [x] The world economy is kinda **fucked**
- [x] You are **dumb**
- [x] Your goal is to **make a love potion**
- [x] You take actions to fulfill that goal
- [x] And you pay the cost. Every. Single. Time.

---

## ⏱️ Scope & Time

I have to make all this in just **3 days**, using **no game engine** and the god language: `C++`.

Why no engine?  
> because → **fuck me I hate myself.**

---

# ✅ To-do

But first — I tried making it modular…  
Then I was like *“nahhh”*, it’ll slow me down, and I don’t have time to make something perfect rn.  
So yeah, this is in a single file **for now**.  
I’ll refactor after the jam ends — that’s Future Me’s problem.

Back to basics for now.

### Things that I know how to do but I’m procrastinating because I’m a sloth and a professional procrastinator:
- [x] Load the tilemap (hmm i can't think of smt else rn yeah wish me luck chat!!!)

> also new hatsune miku albums are so fire omg

---

## 💬 Small Talk

**18:32 → 3 days left + 2 smt hrs**

Ok I feel the pressure now  
And it's ONLY the tilemap 😭  
I haven't decided anything on how the game will progress or how the story will go, but maybe I got smt — writing it here ↓↓↓

---

## 📜 Game Flow (??)

The game will start with the **indoor stuff**, explaining the story and what you need to do.

Then there's maybe an **open field**??

Actually nah — I don’t even have NPCs or a tilemap yet lmao

---

### ❗REALITY CHECK

I’m probs over-scoping it

Need to go SIMPLE
Very very simple
Like babygame simple

I got no idea what I’m doing suddenly  
Send help pls

---

## ✨ OKAY SAVING IDEA INCOMING ✨

I’m gonna **limit the player’s movement**  
This entire game is gonna be INDOORS  
That means:

- 🚫 No quests
- 🚫 No NPCs
- 🚫 No outside world
- ✅ Just potion brewing chaos

---

### Sooo How Do I Interpolate the Theme?

🎰 **BINGO — here's the core loop:**

You're stuck inside trying to make the perfect love potion.

But!  
Every time you add something to the potion, **it costs you something**.

Like:
- Add too much mushroom? → Potion is stronger, but you age 5x faster  
- Add ghost hair? → +Charm, but your memory gets wiped  
- Add glitter? → Looks fab, but you attract cursed tax spirits

So the goal is to **make the perfect potion and get the best huzz**  
(aka the best possible ending)

---

If I somehow finish early maybe I’ll throw in some weak-ass enemies or frogs or cursed taxes or whatever.

Let’s get this thing going.  
Hell yeah.  
I’m feeling **so creatively horny rn** LET’S GO.

### 🗣️ devlog (small chat)
***ok so uhh fuck 2 days 13 hrs left*** ⏲️❗

the tilemap is loading now it's time to get the collision down and some game play game play is lit dead and i hate my school fuck those bitch'o ass they know nothing fucking bunch of dickheads yuck man i wanna be smt asap to escape this hell

## ☑️ today's todo ->
  - [ ] get the collision working
  - [ ] basic gameplay done maybe just the brewing

### 🧠 the plan that i have in my mind
  first i will get the collision down then i will just make bunch of variable which will edit player's states and yeah ig it's easy after this hope so the game looks ass rn frfr the player looks very small and the movement is ass as well and the code ughhh sucks!!!! truly spaghetti codde
