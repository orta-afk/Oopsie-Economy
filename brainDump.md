## üéØ The Plan

The theme is **"Every Action Has a Cost."**  
I asked ChatGPT for name ideas and I **really liked** the name: `Oopsie Economy`.  
So I‚Äôll make something around city-building or resource-spending, where you do stuff and it *costs* you something.

I don't wanna use basic stuff like health or generic player stats.  
I want it to be *dumb* and *unique* (spelling errors are free flavor ‚Äî don‚Äôt file an issue on it üíÄ).

---

## üß™ The Idea

Since I‚Äôm a dumb guy, I‚Äôll make the player also make **dumb decisions** with money (or some cursed in-game currency) in order to progress.

You are a **wizard**.  
A lonely, kinda pathetic wizard.  
And like me, you want a girlfriend üòî.

So the wizard‚Äôs goal is to make a **love potion**.

But what kind of potions? Hmm...

üí° Got it ‚Äî ***Love potions.***  
Why?  
Because the wizard is down bad and wants to fall in love. How wholesome. (and a lil desperate)

But here's the twist:  
You need **money/items/resources to do ANYTHING**, and the economy is totally janked.

Even though you're trying to collect ingredients, you're constantly getting scammed, or your actions backfire.

---

## üê∏ Setup

You play as a **delusional wizard** trying to win the love of his crush ‚Äî maybe another wizard, a frog, or a tax collector.  
(Frog crush is fire ngl.)

But: **the economy is cursed AF**.  
Every time you try to do something (gather, buy, steal, etc.), you get scammed, overcharged, or cause chaos.

> You must collect all ingredients before the economy collapses, you go broke, or worse‚Ä¶ fall in love with your own potion üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

---

## üéÆ Game Loop Breakdown

**Your Actions =** Trying to collect stuff  
**Your Costs =** The consequences of your dumb decisions

### Costs Can Be:
- You get scammed
- You lose something random
- The economy reacts (prices surge, taxes increase, shops close)
- NPCs remember your dumb choices
- Frogs revolt. Literally.
- The game gets *progressively worse*

The more you mess around, the more the world starts to fall apart. That's the point.

---

## üß† Summary

The main thing is:
- [x] The world economy is kinda **fucked**
- [x] You are **dumb**
- [x] Your goal is to **make a love potion**
- [x] You take actions to fulfill that goal
- [x] And you pay the cost. Every. Single. Time.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Scope & Time

I have to make all this in just **3 days**, using **no game engine** and the god language: `C++`.

Why no engine?  
> because ‚Üí **fuck me I hate myself.**

---

# ‚úÖ To-do

But first ‚Äî I tried making it modular‚Ä¶  
Then I was like *‚Äúnahhh‚Äù*, it‚Äôll slow me down, and I don‚Äôt have time to make something perfect rn.  
So yeah, this is in a single file **for now**.  
I‚Äôll refactor after the jam ends ‚Äî that‚Äôs Future Me‚Äôs problem.

Back to basics for now.

### Things that I know how to do but I‚Äôm procrastinating because I‚Äôm a sloth and a professional procrastinator:
- [x] Load the tilemap (hmm i can't think of smt else rn yeah wish me luck chat!!!)

> also new hatsune miku albums are so fire omg

---

## üí¨ Small Talk

**18:32 ‚Üí 3 days left + 2 smt hrs**

Ok I feel the pressure now  
And it's ONLY the tilemap üò≠  
I haven't decided anything on how the game will progress or how the story will go, but maybe I got smt ‚Äî writing it here ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

---

## üìú Game Flow (??)

The game will start with the **indoor stuff**, explaining the story and what you need to do.

Then there's maybe an **open field**??

Actually nah ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even have NPCs or a tilemap yet lmao

---

### ‚ùóREALITY CHECK

I‚Äôm probs over-scoping it

Need to go SIMPLE
Very very simple
Like babygame simple

I got no idea what I‚Äôm doing suddenly  
Send help pls

---

## ‚ú® OKAY SAVING IDEA INCOMING ‚ú®

I‚Äôm gonna **limit the player‚Äôs movement**  
This entire game is gonna be INDOORS  
That means:

- üö´ No quests
- üö´ No NPCs
- üö´ No outside world
- ‚úÖ Just potion brewing chaos

---

### Sooo How Do I Interpolate the Theme?

üé∞ **BINGO ‚Äî here's the core loop:**

You're stuck inside trying to make the perfect love potion.

But!  
Every time you add something to the potion, **it costs you something**.

Like:
- Add too much mushroom? ‚Üí Potion is stronger, but you age 5x faster  
- Add ghost hair? ‚Üí +Charm, but your memory gets wiped  
- Add glitter? ‚Üí Looks fab, but you attract cursed tax spirits

So the goal is to **make the perfect potion and get the best huzz**  
(aka the best possible ending)

---

If I somehow finish early maybe I‚Äôll throw in some weak-ass enemies or frogs or cursed taxes or whatever.

Let‚Äôs get this thing going.  
Hell yeah.  
I‚Äôm feeling **so creatively horny rn** LET‚ÄôS GO.

### üó£Ô∏è devlog (small chat)
***ok so uhh fuck 2 days 13 hrs left*** ‚è≤Ô∏è‚ùó

the tilemap is loading now it's time to get the collision down and some game play game play is lit dead and i hate my school fuck those bitch'o ass they know nothing fucking bunch of dickheads yuck man i wanna be smt asap to escape this hell

## ‚òëÔ∏è today's todo ->
  - [x] get the collision working
  - [ ] basic gameplay done maybe just the brewing

### üß† the plan that i have in my mind
  first i will get the collision down then i will just make bunch of variable which will edit player's states and yeah ig it's easy after this hope so the game looks ass rn frfr the player looks very small and the movement is ass as well and the code ughhh sucks!!!! truly spaghetti codde

### üåô Midnight Chat ‚Äì 11:20 PM  
**‚è≥ Time Left: 1 Day, 22 Hours, some mins**

Okay so, progress update:  
Basic game is working!! Took me 1.5 days to get here, which‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real‚Äîshould‚Äôve taken 1 hour if I was using an actual game engine üò©  
BUT I enjoy the pain and like saying ‚ÄúI speak C++‚Äù so here we are lol. I am built different. I am weird. üëæ

Also‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm feeling kinda lonely rn ngl üò≠  
Why am I typing this in the devlog?? Who knows. Someone hug me.

### üß™ Game Jam Plan (Final Countdown)

- [ ] ‚úÖ **Get the basic gameplay loop done**  
  _(Potion making system + core machine logic)_
  
- [ ] üé® **Polish it up**  
  _(Add sound, menu, maybe some cute transitions or animations)_
  
- [ ] üíÄ **If time magically exists, maybe: ENEMIES?!**
